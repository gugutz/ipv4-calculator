# ipv4-calculator
This was a project i made in my first semester in college, for my Programming Logic class. 
This was also the first application i made in C.

It asks for an IPv4 address and a subnet mask as input, and outputs the Network and Broadcast IPs, first and last hosts addresses, number of hosts for that network and the Wildcard address.

The algorithim is entirely procedural, and also very simple (and badly coded).
Saving it here for the good memories.

To compile (in Linux) run:
gcc main.c -o nameyouwant
